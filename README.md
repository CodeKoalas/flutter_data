# Flutter Data

## Goals/values

  - Zero-bullshit, opinionated way to structure data-driven Flutter apps (ActiveRecord style)
  - Composable: simple should be easy, complex should be possible
  - Minimize boilerplate when working with data in Flutter
  - Glue between UI and data sources in Flutter apps
  - Tightly integrate with other known and loved libraries in the ecosystem (but require none)
  - "An ecosystem of tools and best practices for the pragmatic flutter developer"
  - Scales well (up AND down)
  - Makes the obvious thing

## Usage

(In progress.)
